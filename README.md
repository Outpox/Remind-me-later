### What is it ###
This is an extension wich will remind you a tab you saved earlier. I'm using chrome inbuilt notifications
to remind you the link and open it for you. I've got several planned features like :

* Custom URL
* Current timers list
* Reminder on a given date
* Sync timers with your account in order to access it from anywhere
* Any idea ?

### What is this repository for? ###

* Sources of my Google Chrome extension : "Remind me later"
* Version 0.9
* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remind-me-later/kjmlffmiibifbajomhhoojpgmdiccknj

This extension is a fun project to me. I'm just trying some new stuff.  
My original purpose was to try the chrome api. I'm now beeing a bit more implicated since I received
some good feedback about this.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just go on the above link and install the extension
* Only for Google Chrome (& Chromium)

### How to use ? ###

You're browsing the internet, you need to do something else and need to close a tab ?  

* Just go on the wanted tab
* Click the Clock icon of Remind me later
* Select a duration
* Voila, the link will be reminded later, you can now close this tab
